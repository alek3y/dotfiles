Installation
------------
The i3 configuration and pkglist.txt files are based off of the environment set up by archinstall on Arch (heh, lazy :P).

Fonts
-----
Apparently nerd-fonts v2.1.0 are completely broken (#509), so make sure to use the .local/share/fonts/update.py script to download them from master.

Theme
-----
As for the theme, I chose Mint-Y-Dark-Orange with its matching Mint-Y-Dark-Orange icon theme and the Mocu Black Right cursor theme.
