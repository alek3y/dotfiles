Installation
------------
The i3 configuration and pkglist.txt files are based off of the environment set up by archinstall on Arch (heh, lazy :P).

Fonts
-----
Apparently nerd-fonts v2.1.0 are completely broken (#509), so make sure to use the .local/share/fonts/update.py script to download them from master.

Theme
-----
As for the theme, I chose Mint-Y-Dark-Orange with its matching Mint-Y-Dark-Orange icon theme and the Mocu Black Right cursor theme.

Suspend
-------
For the laptop to suspend when the lid gets closed the line
	HandleLidSwitch=suspend
has to be uncommented inside of the /etc/systemd/logind.conf file.
After this change make sure to restart the systemd-logind service.

Headphones
----------
In order for the headphones to work correctly the following command must be run
	sudo sh -c "echo 'options snd-hda-intel model=alc255-acer,dell-headset-multi' >> /etc/modprobe.d/sound.conf"
which comes from the repo (https://github.com/nekr0z/linux-on-huawei-matebook-13-2019#soundcard) of my laptop.

If there's any popping involved, you can fix it with https://askubuntu.com/a/1230834.
